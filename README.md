# AHTA
Repository to make all code available that was used during the project for the course of Applied High-Throughput Analysis at Ghent University, taught by Prof. Dr. Ir. Tim De Meyer and Ir. Louis Coussement.

The code code that was used to analyze a single dataset is available in a document stating with the name of the dataset, followed by its accession number. For every of these files, a knitted (.pdf) version is made available.

Microarray1,2,RNAseq_combined contains the code that was used to compare findings from these three datasets. This file contains the entire processing of every dataset, and describes from line 848 on the comparison of datasets. For this file we also provide a knitted (.pdf) version.
